# bin7:Solution(nope)

This was Louie's challenge. I think everyone figured that out quickly. A combination of the binary name and the fact that he is very vocal about his challenges made it quite clear.

We all learned quite quickly that the challenge used the esoteric language 'brainfuck' which only has 8 commands in it. Learning to use this language to get a flag was too time consuming on top of my other responsibilities. 

(I was told it was type confusion or brute forcable)
